# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Aspiring Cloud Engineer currently using GitHub to store my personal projects and scripts. 

<br>

:blue_book: <a href="https://github.com/cmeadowstech/scripts">[scripts]</a> - Currently just PowerShell, though hopefully I can add Python soon. Maybe a sprinkling of Bicep as well. 

:computer: <a href="https://github.com/cmeadowstech/Website">[website]</a> - For the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>. Currently half complete until I can pick up Python and/or JavaScript. On the way!
